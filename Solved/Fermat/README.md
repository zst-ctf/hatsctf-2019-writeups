# Fermat
Crypto

## Challenge 

So you only have the modulus, there is no way to factorize it is there?

Challenge by: Ariana

## Hint

Fermat factorization

## Solution

We are given N and C. 

We see from the source code that the primes are close to each other.

We solve using fermat factorisation and then we can decrypt.

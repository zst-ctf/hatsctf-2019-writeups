## Challenge 

This is a small introduction to elliptic curve cryptography. Can you find the flaws in the implementation?

A 'simple' introduction to elliptic curves can be found at https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/elliptic/explicit.html

at least the addition is clear

Challenge by: Ariana

## Hint

Find what is the curve parameters and modulus

Notice something about the discriminant of the curve?

Can you transform the curve to having a double root at (0,0)

Consider the curve y^2=x^2(x+a^2). What happens when you map points on the curve to the integers with (y+ax)/(y-ax)?

Factor p, it is actually a composite number
